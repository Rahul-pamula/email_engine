# Phase 6 — Analytics & Engagement Tracking (Final Audit)

> **Status: ✅ Complete** — verified March 15, 2026

## Scope validated
- **Tracking integrity**: `/track/open/{dispatch_id}` and `/track/click` enforce HMAC signatures (`TRACKING_SECRET`), reject forged payloads (400), and record `email_events` with `is_bot` derived from UA/IP + timing + honeypot flag.
- **Bot suppression**: Honeypot link injection in worker, Apple/Gmail proxy UA fragments, proxy IP ranges, and “click <2s after open” heuristic all set `is_bot=true` so analytics exclude scanners.
- **Data model**: `email_events` (migration 012) includes `tenant_id, campaign_id, dispatch_id, contact_id, event_type, url, ip_address, user_agent, is_bot, created_at` with indexes on `campaign_id`, `dispatch_id`, `event_type`, `created_at` to keep aggregations fast. Retention guidance: monthly partition on `created_at` when row count >50M.
- **APIs**: `analytics.py` returns campaign summary + recipients, filtering `is_bot=false`. Sender-health endpoint reuses the same filtered events.
- **UI**: `/campaigns/[id]/analytics` renders KPIs and recipient timeline from the analytics APIs (client-side fetch with loading + error states).

## Changes delivered this pass
- HMAC verification and honeypot handling added to `tracking.py`; invalid or tampered links no longer mutate analytics.
- Worker now signs pixels/links with the same secret and adds a hidden honeypot anchor per dispatch.
- Bot detection now considers UA/IP + timing + honeypot and marks `is_bot` accordingly.
- Campaign analytics page wired to the live APIs; types tightened via `AnalyticsResponse` / `Recipient` interfaces.

## Operational notes
- Set the same `TRACKING_SECRET` in API and worker environments before deploy; rotate by updating env and restarting both services.
- If privacy rules require, IP/UA can be nulled before insert in `tracking.py` (toggle-ready).
- Add a monthly `email_events` partition + `created_at` TTL when volume grows; current indexes handle present load.
