# Email Engine — Complete Phase Plan

> This document is the **strategic planning guide** for the Email Engine platform.
> It describes what each phase is, why it exists, what it covers, and the technical architecture behind it.
> Progress tracking (what is done vs. pending) lives in the **interactive HTML tracker** (`docs/progress.html`).

Each phase is divided into TWO parts:
  [BACKEND] — API, database, worker logic
  [FRONTEND] — Pages, components, UX flows

---

## 🏗 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE: DUAL EMAIL ENGINE
To prevent platform/system emails from going to spam due to DMARC/Spoofing rules, the system uses TWO entirely separate email pipelines:

1. **CENTRALIZED SYSTEM EMAILER (Queue-First via Gmail SMTP)**
   - Uses `shrmail.app@gmail.com` via standard secure SMTP.
   - Purpose: Handles critical platform-to-tenant communications (OTP verifications, sender confirmation, quota warnings, welcome emails, team invites).
   - Why: Guarantees Inbox delivery for critical app functions without needing a verified custom domain.

2. **TENANT CAMPAIGN EMAILER (Self-Hosted MTA / Transact Provider)**
   - Uses the tenant's own verified custom domain (e.g. `sales@theircompany.com`).
   - Purpose: Bulk marketing campaigns, newsletters, subscriber communications.
   - Why: Isolates sender reputation and handles high-volume throughput.

## Phase 0 — UI/UX Foundation & Design System
**WHY:** Establishes the visual language, reusable UI primitives, interaction rules, and accessibility baseline before feature work scales.

**[BACKEND]**
- Mailhog added to docker-compose for local email testing and debugging.
- Database seed script (`seed_dev_data.py`) for reproducible development states.
- Standardized environment variables fully documented in `.env.example`.

**[FRONTEND]**
- Dark-mode first design tokens in `globals.css` bridged via `tailwind.config.ts`.
- Typography scale and semantic color set defined.

- Standard page layout pattern: Breadcrumb -> PageHeader -> Stat row -> DataTable -> EmptyState.
- Accessible modal implementations with focus traps, escape-to-close, and visible outlines.
- WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast validation and minimum 44x44px touch-target guidance enforced.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation, Auth, Tenant Identity & Onboarding
**WHY:** Turns a standalone app into a multi-tenant SaaS product. Establishes user identity, tenant identity, onboarding workflows, and route guards.

**[BACKEND]**
- Custom email/password auth using bcrypt and JWT validation.
- JWT payloads carry `tenant_id`, `user_id`, `role`, and `email` for rapid authorization.
- Tenant membership model linking `users`, `tenants`, via a `tenant_users` join table.
